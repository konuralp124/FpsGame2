Until now, the following are implemented:

-   A basic scene. Will develop it once I start to add enemies.
-   The character
-   Basic scene and character are adjusted in terms of size, and collisions are checked.
-   Weapon is added to the character. Weapon can shoot but there is no impact yet. Instead, it prints "hit" in the console right now.

What should be done:
The scene will be improved. Shooting impact will be created. Weapon for now does not collide with surroundings; it will collide. Enemy drones will be implemented.
